# BayesianNetwork_Cartpole_with_RL

## Overview
This project aims to leverage the principles of Bayesian networks to provide a comprehensive explanation for the behavior exhibited by an agent operating within RL algorithm. It seeks to bridge the gap between the complex dynamics of RL algorithms and human-understandable explanations by utilizing the explanatory power of Bayesian networks.
